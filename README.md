# Advanced-Calculator-Implementation-with-Java

Welcome to the Advanced Calculator Implementation project. This Java program accepts one of three words: DOUBLE, INTEGER, STRING. Then, it accepts an integer N, the total number of commands. Finally, N commands are inputted. Each command should be performed as follows:

. The "+" command means the calculator should either sum up two numbers or concatenate two strings, and print the result to the output.
. The "−" command means the calculator should either subtract two numbers and print the result to the output, or print "Unsupported operation for strings".
. The "∗" command means calculator should either multiply two numbers and print the result to the screen, or for strings, it should repeat the first argument amount of times given in the second argument (a positive integer number), otherwise print "Wrong argument type".
. The "/" command means the calculator should either divide two numbers and print the result to the output or print "Unsupported operation for strings".
